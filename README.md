# TwitterAwarenessBot

This TwitterBot will take the ten most recent tweets from pages such as 
the American Red Cross, American Cancer Society, and UNICEF, and retweet them. 
The goal of this project is help "crowd-fund" awareness of some of the biggest issues/problems 
that we face in society today.
